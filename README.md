# Palette Generator

This tool serves to generate a palette for people who want to create a UI without any knowledge on how to pick out the colors for their application.
It's not a very clever tool, so you should press generate palettes until you find one that you find pleasing.

# Demo

The project is built and hosted [here](https://palette-generator.tallang.no).

# Get started

The project is created through the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/). See their default readme for instructions.
